LEVEL DESIGN
-----------------------
level 1: basic flat level with walls guiding ball around platform
leads to standard stairs going upwards
level 2: basic flat level with walls again but some parts of the ground are moving platforms so the ball has to jump properly
leads to stairs with walls that force the ball to zig zag upward
level 3: same thing platform style, moving platforms again, one part is a very thin platform (like a rope) that the ball has to carefully cross over

NICE TO HAVE FEATURES
-----------------------
- if patient falls off level x (by determining rigid body y position less than -10) then restart position at beginning of level x after stairs

OUTLINE OF PROMPT
-----------------------
- get new repo where team can collaborate
- this git repo is not the same as git repo for A assignments
- use this one repo for ALL Unity projects
- this means each team has one repo for A and one for B
- Use this link: fork template structure of unity projects into your group acc in Github
    (refer to A1 instruction if not created yet)
