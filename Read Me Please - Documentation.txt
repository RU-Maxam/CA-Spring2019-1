Roll a Ball Project Documentation by Xavier La Rosa
-----------------------------------------------------------
- This is inspired from the Roll a Ball game with a bit of a twist where there are two players involved. There is a green ball (Player 1) and red ball (player 2).
- There are "gems" scattered across the playing field where each ball may collect. These gems are scattered at different heights too. 
- To win the game a player must have more points than the other.
- To the left side you will see UI of player 1's gem count, timer starting at 120 seconds or 2 minutes.
- To the middle you will see a UI restart button and a main menu button and a hidden text that displays the winner at the end.
- To the right you will see UI of player 2's gem count.
- User may restart the game, or go to main menu.
- To know when the game ends there is a method that checks using global variables of total count player1 count and player2 count of gems
	- this method activates when either the sum of both player's gem counts = 13 OR the time runs out to 0.00f
	- this method compares scores of both classes (player scripts)
	- this method then has 3 separate cases of player 1 wins, player 2 wins, or TIE.
- The jump for each ball has been specified to give it a more "natural gamer jump" feel to it.
	- this involed using an offset on the gravity of Vector3 which was pretty interesting to see how it can influence player jump
- A Main Menu was added to satisfy the restart AND play buttons for the user. User may even quit the program.

Acknowledged Errors
-----------------------------------------------------------
- When launching the game there are constraint conditions depending on the screen used where the UI HUD text font is considerably small.
- If users try to jump at the same time there is chance for one to not actually jump because of key ghost issues
- If users head straight into a wall there is a slight chance they may be stuck into the wall and prevent movement unless the other user collides to "wake up" the game object again.
- I was not able to figure out how to have points deducted when balls collide to walls in an efficient way.
- Users cannot deduct points off each other if one "attacks" the other by jumping ontop of them.
- There were no tangible attempts to the extra credit portion

Areas of Improvement
-----------------------------------------------------------
I would have loved to make the collisions work to deduct points.
I would have wanted to add a second platform for different colored gems that are worth more but much more risk if the user fails the jump to the platform
I would have added moving ground platforms so the user must grab the gem at the right moment where there is surface below the gem.
Ultimately, it would be really cool to use networking to create a multiplayer segment and post it onto a webpage.
